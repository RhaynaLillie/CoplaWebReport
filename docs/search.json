This is a demo only.\nThis platform is web-hosted so you can simply share a link with collaborators for their review.\n\nMaps and charts are intended to represent general patterns, and are almost always limited to most common types (e.g., ecosystems). You can use the “zoom” tool to take a closer look.\nAll maps, input datasets and further assistance can be obtained by contacting the author, Randy Swaty."
